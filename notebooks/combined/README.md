## Basic notebooks for design
- ProteinMPNN_design_and_folding
    - Use ProteinMPNN to dessign/redesign a PDB (upload, from PDB, or UniProt)
    - predict new sequences with AF2
- RFdiffusionAA_ligandMPNN
    - Run RFDiffusion all atom, e.g. define catalytic residues to hold in place and hold ligand in place
    - run ligandMPNN for created backbones
- RFdiffusion_MPNN_AF_pipeline
    - run classic pipeline for design
    - use RFdiffusion for unconditional/conditional backbone generation
    - design created sequences/monomers/binder using ProteinMPNN
    - run Alphafold to predict the structure
